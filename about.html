    <h2>Spencer the Duck</h2>
    <p>Spencer is the feathery genius behind DuckLabs — a master of calm, clever infrastructure and elegant solutions. Equal parts architect and adventurer, Spencer has a knack for simplifying complex problems and automating chaos out of existence.

    A proud father of four ducklings, Spencer balances DevOps wizardry with family life and a deep appreciation for fine whiskey (single malt only, thank you very much). When he’s not optimizing cloud deployments or perfecting CI/CD flows, you’ll find him gliding across calm waters with a neat glass of whiskey in one wing and a plan in the other.

    "Quack less. Build more.™"</p>

    <h2>Turley the Duck</h2>
    <p>Turley is a quirky, cloud-loving DevOps wizard by day and a groovy guitar-strumming musician by night. With his trusty laptop in one wing and a vintage Stratocaster in the other, Turley automates pipelines, squashes bugs, and deploys microservices with a smile. Whether he's jamming with friends or configuring Kubernetes clusters, Andrew brings harmony to both code and chords.</p>
